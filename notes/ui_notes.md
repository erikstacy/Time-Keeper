[Open Source Illistration](https://www.manypixels.co/gallery/?s=clock)

### Illistrations Front and Center

- Grabs the users attention FOR SURE
- The illistration should be a primary focus of the app

### Serif Fonts

- For years, sans serif has been the go to font
- This hasn't changed, but they've taken a new role
- Serif Fonts
	- These are the primary, never changing texts
	- These fonts will have the main focus
- Sans Serif Fonts
	- These fonts are for supporting roles
	- Also any changing data should be this font

### Futuristic Color Overload

- Make your app colorful
- Specific colors
	- Purple, blue, pink, and neon colors
- Using gradients is also a great way to make things pop
	- This always looks better than a flat color

## Rounded Shapes

- These imperfect, soft shapes are popular right now
- Not just circles, but also just curves in the app

## Dark Mode

DON'T NEED TO TRY AND EXPLAIN THIS ONE TO ME BUB, I'M ALL IN.
